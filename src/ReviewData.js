The quality of these beans is a 10/10 and I will be most definitely buying again. They have delisious smell and taste. Shipping was super quick, only 5 business days.",

A step above Xcoffeestore, but so much better quality. One thing I didn't mention well is that customer service tends to be a bit slow in the morning when I'm on my way to work and want to get my coffee as soon as possible. But other than that, coffee quality is great for me :)",

Still the same owner and he remembers my wife and I every time.  He's great. The food is great and it has a wonderful corner table with a huge window that just gives you a nice city feel.",

It's place you come to enjoy a cozy local environment and build a connection with the owner. Very nice vibe and a very unique place with well priced coffee. Please let places like this strive, hangout out here with your friends and family, and enjoy coffee, company, and culture.",

Coffee was great, sandwich options were nice. Nice place to sit, mingle and enjoy coffee. I miss atmospheric shops like this in LA.",
